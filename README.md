# RicksGuitars
Java application for online guitar store. Can search for guitars from inventory. 

This program is centred around the search tool in Inventory.java. This was supposed to showcase some best practice OO, especially encapsulation.

1. Make sure your software does what the customer wants it to do.
    We started out by fixing some of the functionality problems with the search tool.
    Added some more functionality, so that the search returns a list of guitars.
2. Apply basic OO principles to ad flexibility
    While adding features, tied to make improvements on design choices.
    Encapsulated out the guitar properties.
    Made sure we could add new properties to the application easily.
3. Strive for a maintainable, reusable design.
    Add delegation so that objects are less dependent on each other, and can be reused easily.
